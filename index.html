              <p>
                One of the fascinating features of natural world is the ability of some insects and animals to camouflage – either as predators to catch its prey, or as prey to hide from predators. There is very little option for a shelter in an open
                ocean. Hence the need for camouflage is perhaps more there. I always get thrilled to see such nature’s programmes embedded in many species. Here is a glimpse for 4 minutes.

              <p>
                Most thriving ecosystems on land are based on tropical forests. Trees and plants are primary producers of food – transforming earth’s nutrients into food using sunlight. Insects, birds and animals depend on trees and plants – both for
                food and shelter. Together, they make a complex system of life based on predator-prey relationship.
                In oceans and seas, similar forests exist. But instead of trees, the static base is provided by corals. Nutrients are supplied by ocean currents. Energy comes from sun again. The sunlight is mostly available in inter-tropical zone and
                near the water surface. Coral reefs are forests of underwater with life mesmerizing varieties and colours. There is an unending stream of videos on coral reefs. I am posting here a couple of them. If you get interested, please check out

              <p>
                You are perhaps grown up with the knowledge that sunlight is the source of all energy produced in earth’s biosphere. At least I had that idea – until I came to know of ‘hydrothermal vents’ and life around them.
                Thousands of cracks are there in the magma chambers beneath the ocean bed. They create a chain of hydrothermal vents all over the ocean floor. These vents spew extremely hot waters which are rich in minerals - coming out of the earth’s
                inner layers – and also provide life’s ingredients. Water around these vents has temperature way above the normal boiling point – but they don’t boil because of heavy pressure. It might be unimaginable to see life in those waters! But
                behold – there exists a complete biological world there without any link to the sun. Instead of photosynthesis, food in this world is generated through chemical processes without sunlight – termed as ‘chemosynthesis’. To know more on
                this process click <a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/vents.html" target="_blank">here.</a>

                “Just like there are waterfalls underneath oceans, there can be lakes on seabed too. One is kept separate from the surrounding body of water by density arising from temperature difference, while the other is kept separate by it’s
                salinity. These saline lakes of dense water on the seafloor have distinctive shorelines and surfaces, and they are called brine pools. They are common in the Gulf of Mexico, where the smallest ones are not much bigger than a puddle,
                measuring just one meter across, but the biggest pools are up to 20 km long...”
                Now see this amazing natural feature in video. What you are seeing is a lake of extremely saline dense water, which is itself under water! That much of salinity is toxic even to the creatures living in saline water. [3 minutes]

                You are familiar with winds – gusts of them can wreck havoc on our assets and life. Did you hear about ‘solar winds’? Do you know how mother earth protects us from the cosmic rays that are continuously threatening life’s existence?
                Also, as water always flows into lower levels, we see flowing water on earth’s uneven surface. Heat also seeks out lower levels through the medium of air and water. It gives rise to the circulation of air and water. In the process of
                heat diffusion across the earth’s ocean and atmosphere, remarkable dynamism is seen in the form of weather systems and ocean currents – each intricately linked with the other. This continuous dynamics on earth’s surface is awesome if
                one can visualize them. Computer simulation could bring these patterns alive to you. Watch out this short video (5 minutes) – it should be a feast for your eyes!

                Now, this one is a substantive documentary on Earth’s climate, its determinants and the scientific advancements in understanding global weather system. Our frontiers of knowledge are always being extended by a remarkable class of
                priests in the temple of science!
                In this documentary, you would get a glimpse of a remarkable community – The ‘Bajau’ People. These so called ‘illiterate people’ possess remarkable knowledge of climate and sea - gathered over generations of their experience living
                totally in sea! Yes, they live their life on boats – on water - they are truly ‘Bedouins’ of sea. They have no home other than a boat. A similar set of people also live in Bangladesh – locally called ‘Bede’. I am not posting separate
                documentaries on them. You are encouraged to explore the web and watch many documentaries available on these people.
                This documentary has many interesting visuals from four different locations on earth. It should help you to understand how the climate system is interconnected through all continents and oceans. Watch it when you have time and proper

                ocean currents and their population flourish whenever they get the appropriate combination of nutrients and sunlight. The nutrient circulation in the oceans, created by ocean currents, decides the density of these micro-organisms –
                which in turn decides the fish density. So watch out this very informative documentary of 16 minutes.

              <h3>How do ocean currents work? - Jennifer Verduin</h3>
              <p>
                After some basic understanding of the shape and dynamics of Earth’s crust and volcanoes, we need to understand basics of our climate system. If you think Climate means weather systems above the surface, you are missing a very basic
                aspect of dynamics and circulation of Earth’s materials and nutrients. Understanding the circulation of water in our oceans should be the first step in deciphering the patterns in our weather system. Here is a short introduction (4.5
                minutes) on Ocean Currents.

              <h3>Deepest Part of The Oceans - Full Documentary HD</h3>
              <p>
                If oceans cover more surface area on earth than land, and if earth’s crust is continuously moving and shifting, it is natural that there would be more frictions under water – on ocean floors – than on land. I am posting this video (45
                minutes) today to let you see some remarkable activities there as well as to learn how scientific knowledge progresses.
                I learned about ‘Mariana Trench’ during my college days, from a book in American Library in Kolkata. I went there to look at books on economics, but some large sized and colourful volumes attracted me. I spent the time mostly with those
                volumes. They contained fascinating pictures on geography and life from different corners of the earth. In those times, there was no Internet, Laptop or Smartphone. Technology changed so fast - you can now see not only still pictures,
                but actual footage of explorations in remote locations on Earth!
                Lastly, most of you know the names of Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin – people first walked on moon. I suspect very few (probably none) of you heard about Don Walsh and Jacques Piccard. They are people who had undertaken a similarly
                daring exploration to the greatest depth of ocean in the world – in the same decade of 1960’s. To some extent, their act was more daring - as they themselves decided to plunge into almost death’s embrace when a normal soul should have
                quit the exploration. This priority of inquisitiveness over life for some people has always pushed the boundaries of knowledge for the mankind. You should appreciate that.

              <p>
                After the two short videos on active volcanoes, here is a nice documentary (26 minutes) where you can see the actual footages of birth of a volcanic island completely out of sea. It happened in the 1960’s. Again, you are advised to
                check out the ‘Surtsey’ island on Google Earth (near Iceland) just before or after watching it. The videography at that time was not of present days’ quality – but these frames would take you to the authentic past. The importance of
                this documentary is to observe how nature brings life onto a new place it created! The birth of this island has provided a unique opportunity for geologists and botanists to carry out scientific observations. As students, you should
                appreciate all the researchers seen here, who constantly enhance the boundaries of our scientific knowledge.

                has not stopped. Imagine an island with a population settled in one part...and magma flowing in another part for more than two decades!Yes - look at this short video and see yourself. It is only 4 minutes’. But I sincerely advice you to
                have a close look at Hawai Islands’ topography through Google Earth. Do it immediately before or after watching this video. That will increase the effect of this post.

              <h3>Faces of Earth - Shaping the Planet</h3>
              <p>
                After the previous two short videos on plate tectonics and birth of Himalayas, I am sharing now a substantial documentary to understand the dynamics of earth’s crust. It is a 45 minute video and have several parts separated by few seconds of blank screen. This is today’s last post on this page. Tomorrow I would move on to another topic.
                If you want to enjoy this video better, I would suggest you to start with Google Earth first and have a good look at the continents and oceans in their current shapes. Zoom in to the location of ‘Afar’ in Ethiopia (you can easily locate by searching it). It is experiencing a remarkable geological phenomenon at present – which is the starting point of this documentary. Specifically look at the positions of Greece and Mediterranean Sea to the north of Africa and the big island of Madagascar to the east of Africa. These visual frames in your head should help you to follow the documentary in a more consuming way.
                Between 34.35 minutes to 38.10 minutes in this video, you will be seeing the journey of Indian subcontinent. You should also understand why the major rivers in China flow from west to east. You should appreciate the fact that we are living on a very active surface on earth. Do you know that it generates 12000 earthquakes per year? Watch out and see!

I am posting this short video (3.40 minutes - in Hindi, but I think all of us would understand) which I came across. In our next online meeting session, I would like to point out to some geographical features of the Himalayas and the Tibetan plateau, which should look fascinating after watching these videos.

              <h3>Plate Tectonics Theory Lesson</h3>
              <p>
                After getting a glimpse of the formation of earth and its evolution over millions of years, we should proceed to understand our present geography. As I told earlier, it is crucial to understand our societies and livelihood. But do you realize that the geography we see now is actually a very dynamic one?
                We see our countries and continents as fixed entities. They remain the same for our lifetime – and may have been the same for hundreds or thousands of years. But when we talk about million-year time scale, they are very dynamic indeed. The dynamism of earth surface has not been reduced by any measure over years. The visible proofs are regular earthquakes and volcanic eruptions in different parts of the world.
                We perhaps heard that once upon a time, there was a sea named ‘Tethys’. Most of India is made of a landmass named ‘Gondwana’. Himalayas were created when that Gonwanaland lifted the bottom of the Tethys. Our knowledge (assuming none of us are specializing in geography) remains sketchy beyond this point. What most of us fail to understand is the importance of ‘Plate Tectonics’. It is very important to have a good idea of the Plate Tectonic Theory. It will clarify almost all geological events we face now. You will be fascinated to see how India was part of Africa at some previous time. And you should appreciate the importance of scientific enquiry and bent of mind of remarkable people who helped us to understand our modern existence. This short (9 minute) video should augment your knowledge and understanding of world geography.

              <h3>Naked Science - Birth of the Earth</h3>
              <p>
                We want to understand our position with respect to our surroundings natural, social and economic environment. Current social environment is largely shaped by our traditional production activities. All the productive activities – traditional and current – are somehow related to the surrounding natural resources, climate and geography. Understanding climate and geography of the world needs some basic knowledge of the formation of earth in our universe. How we –human beings – came on earth? And how the earth came into being? From where? These are the questions that fascinated me for years, before I gathered some understanding based on scientific documentaries. Earth is a lively entity that is formed out of cosmic materials and forces – and is still actively evolving. Unless we have a fair understanding of the earth’s active geological processes, we cannot really grasp the events like movements of tectonic plates resulting in earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions. All these are big natural events disrupting our current economic life. We also need to understand the climatic events like cyclones, wild fires – which are also closely related to the ongoing geological processes.
                So, I would begin with a documentary on evolution of Earth. There are many other similar and related documentaries you can find through a little search. You are encouraged to explore the internet more if you find it interesting. This one is of 50 minutes duration. Remember, in this time you are watching an evolution that took billions of years.
                [1 million = 1,000,000; 1 billion = 1,000,000,000 and 1 trillion = 1,000,000,000,000 !!!]
